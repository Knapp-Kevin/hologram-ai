The two versions are identical - there are no differences between the ARCH VERSION and the SUBPROJECT VERSION. The merged result is the same as both inputs:

# hologram-ai — Project Overview

`hologram-ai` is a Rust-first, inference-first compiler and runtime integration
layer that imports AI model artifacts (ONNX, GGUF, GGML) and makes them
executable on the Hologram architecture.

---

## What it is

A compiler pipeline and runtime session library. Its job is to:

1. **Ingest** foreign model artifacts (ONNX protobuf, GGUF binary, GGML checkpoint)
2. **Normalize** them into a canonical `AiGraph` intermediate representation
3. **Optimize** the graph via compile-time passes (fusion, folding, shape propagation)
4. **Plan memory** — resolve tensor lifetimes, buffer aliasing, KV-cache sizing
5. **Lower** the graph into a `hologram::Graph + ExecutionSchedule`
6. **Execute** inference via the Hologram execution backend
7. **Stream** autoregressive token output for LLM workloads

---

## What it is not

- Not a wrapper around ONNX Runtime, llama.cpp, or any other inference engine
- Not an AI application framework
- Not a training system (inference-first; training future scope)
- Not a fork of any existing system

Reference runtimes (ONNX Runtime, llama.cpp) are used only for **validation
and testing**, never as the execution substrate.

## Relationship to hologram

```
hologram-ai
  └── depends on → hologram  (graph execution, memory, runtime, artifacts)
```

`hologram` remains AI-agnostic and sandbox-agnostic. All AI-specific
concerns — model formats, quantization, attention semantics, KV-cache,
token generation — live in `hologram-ai`.

See [ADR-0001](../../adrs/0001-repo-boundary.md) for the general repo boundary
policy and [ADR-0002](../../adrs/0002-hologram-ai-canonical-ir.md) for the
hologram-ai specific boundary.
