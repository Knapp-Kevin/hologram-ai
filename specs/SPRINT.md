# Current Sprint — hologram-ai

## Sprint Goal

**Correct ONNX execution, then optimize.**

All ONNX ops compile and execute faithfully — every node matches ORT within
tolerance. No premature fusion or optimization until the baseline is proven.

**Design principle:** hologram-ai is a compiler only (ADR-0016). It ships
zero runtime code. All kernels belong in hologram base crate.

---

## Milestone: ONNX Correctness (DONE)

- [x] **Fully static shapes at compile time** — all dims concretized to
  `context_length` (seq-like) or 1 (batch-like). No 0-sentinels, no runtime
  shape walker needed. `--seq-len` CLI flag for user override.
- [x] **AttentionFusion** — 22 SDPA chains fused into GroupedQueryAttention
  ops. Conformance tests pass (GQA flat, expanded, scaled dot product).
- [x] **KvSlotInjection** — KV cache write/read ops injected after fusion.
  Pipeline archive: prefill (full seq) + decode (seq=1).
- [x] **Node-by-node inspector** — `tinyllama_node_inspector` test dumps all
  intermediate buffers; `compare_node_by_node.py` finds first divergent node.
- [x] **TinyLlama ONNX matches ORT** — all 1156 compared nodes pass.
  Top-5 token predictions identical. Zero failures.
- [x] **TinyLlama generates coherent English** — "I'm not a joke teller,
  I just like to laugh at them!" (causal model, KV cache decode, 1.4 tok/s)

## Active: Performance (make it fast)

### P1: Variable-length prefill (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Wire `ShapeContextGraph` into `HoloRunner.execute()` — project shapes
  at runtime from actual input dimensions instead of compiled seq_len
- [ ] Add `SeqMode::Variable` — no padding, process actual prompt length
- [ ] Expected: prefill ~13s → ~40ms for 6-token prompt (~340x speedup)

### P2: Decode speed — wire Sprint 13 infrastructure (IN PROGRESS)

#### P2a: Execution hot-path fast paths (hologram base, no cross-repo dep)
- [ ] SameAs(0) fast path in `propagate_level_shapes` — skip full shape
  resolution for elementwise ops (~60-70% of nodes, just copy input[0] shape)
- [ ] Skip `input_shapes` gathering in `dispatch_level` for unary ops and
  non-broadcasting binary ops (eliminate per-input HashMap lookups)

#### P2b: Tape executor (hologram base)
- [ ] `TapeBuilder` — pre-resolve kernel fn pointers + `output_elem_size`
  per node at graph-load time (eliminates per-dispatch op match + HashMap
  lookups for `compiled_dtypes`)
- [ ] Wire tape executor into hologram public API (`build_tape_from_plan`,
  `execute_tape`, `execute_tape_with_kv_state`)

#### P2c: Integration (hologram-ai + hologram base)
- [ ] Wire tape executor from `HoloRunner` — build tape at load time, use
  for inference with fallback to `execute_plan`
- [ ] Wire `WeightCache` into tape executor — cache deserialized quantized
  weights across dispatches (currently ~5-10x overhead)
- [ ] Wire `dispatch_float_into` — buffer reuse, eliminate per-op allocation

- [ ] Expected: decode 0.7s/token → <0.1s/token

### P3: Compilation speed (Plan 017)
- [ ] Release profile with LTO (`codegen-units = 1, lto = "thin"`)
- [ ] Early convergence detection in fixpoint loop (break when dynamic dims
  stop decreasing, saves up to 9 pass invocations)
- [ ] Avoid double LLM compilation (clone AiGraph after MVP, concretize
  twice instead of re-importing from disk)
- [ ] Cache `topo_order` on AiGraph (called ~40 times per compilation)

---

## Medium Term: Multi-model support

### Any ONNX model
- [x] Test with ResNet-50 (vision, no attention) — **compilation works** (225 nodes
  after BatchNorm decomposition + constant folding). Conv2d conformance tests pass
  (single Conv2d, stride variants, Conv+Relu+GAP+Flatten+Gemm mini classifier).
- [ ] Test with BERT (encoder-only, bidirectional attention)
- [ ] Test with Stable Diffusion UNet (vision + attention + cross-attention)
- [ ] Test with Whisper (encoder-decoder, audio)
- [ ] Fix any op dispatch failures discovered
- [ ] Goal: `hologram-ai compile -m model.onnx` works for top-20 HuggingFace models

### GGUF models
- [ ] Verify GGUF TinyLlama matches ORT (same approach as ONNX)
- [ ] LUT-GEMM for Q4_0: `FloatOp::MatMulQ4` kernel
- [ ] Goal: GGUF generation at >1 tok/s

---

## Long Term: Production readiness

### Performance
- [ ] Fused attention kernel (proven correct via conformance)
- [ ] KV cache with variable-length sequences
- [ ] Parallel dispatch (rayon level scheduling)
- [ ] Memory-mapped weight loading
- [ ] Multi-modal output trait (text, images, audio, etc.)

### Architecture
- [ ] Simplify post-concretization pipeline (3 fixpoint iterations → 1)
- [ ] Break up large functions, apply Builder pattern

---

## Complete (this sprint)

### Node-by-node inspector tooling
- [x] `execute_plan_with_intermediates_and_shape_hints` in hologram base
- [x] `tinyllama_node_inspector` conformance test
- [x] `compare_node_by_node.py` Python comparator
- [x] `ort_intermediates.py` ORT intermediate dumper

### Static shape compilation
- [x] `concretize_all_dims` uses `context_length` from model metadata
- [x] `--seq-len` CLI flag on compile command
- [x] `seq_len_override` field on `ModelCompiler`
- [x] `SeqMode::FixedPad` only (removed `Variable` variant)
- [x] `HoloRunner::execute` uses `execute_plan` (no shape walker)
- [x] Post-concretization cleanup uses `Concrete(1)` not `Concrete(0)`

### ResNet-50 / multi-model support
- [x] `OpDecomposition` pass: BatchNorm inference decomposition
  (`scale/sqrt(var+eps)`, bias correction, NCHW broadcast via Unsqueeze)
- [x] ResNet-50 compiles: 582 → 225 nodes after BatchNorm decomposition +
  constant folding, 0 warnings
- [x] Conv2d conformance tests (ORT vs hologram): single Conv2d, stride=2,
  padding variants — all pass
- [x] Mini vision classifier conformance test (Conv+Relu+GlobalAvgPool+Flatten+Gemm)
- [x] `onnx_builder::conv2d()` and `mini_vision_classifier()` test builders
- [x] `position_ids` injection pass for KV cache decode

### Sprint 13 hologram correctness fixes
- [x] **Softmax precision**: restored `f32::exp()` — Sprint 13's `fast_exp()`
  (~1.5% error) compounded across 22 layers producing gibberish
- [x] **Shape-aware GlobalAvgPool**: `infer_nchw` heuristic failed for
  non-standard channel counts. Added `dispatch_global_avg_pool_with_shapes`
- [x] **KV cache overflow**: `read_k_through`/`read_v_through` clamped to
  buffer capacity. `set_advance_override` for padded prefill
- [x] **Clippy clean**: all warnings resolved in both repos

### Root causes found and fixed
- [x] **Shape bug**: seq-like dims set to 0-sentinel → RoPE slices produce `[32,1]`
  instead of `[1,4,5,32]` → 1051 of 1067 nodes fail
- [x] **Attention fusion bugs** (documented, fusion now works):
  - K^T not un-transposed (find_pre_transpose stops at Mul)
  - Scale applied on K path not detected (double-scaling)
  - Output shape `[1,1,5,2048]` instead of `[1,32,5,64]`
  - V tensor uses post-expansion 32 heads but kernel expects 4-head GQA
